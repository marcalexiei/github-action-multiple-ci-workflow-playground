Testing multiple required workflow with same job name

## Â Use case

You want multiple CI workflow to be marked as required before merging a PR.
A more detailed example can be found on this [tuono repository issue](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/issues/336).

To achieve this I performed the following steps:

- I added an step with `ci_ok` key and `OK` name on each required workflow.
- Then, on the `main` branch ruleset I added **only one "OK" match**.

> [!CAUTION]
> This causes the following unwanted behavior:
> A merge is allowed even if one of the need jobs is still in progress, as long as at least one `ci_ok` job has already completed.
>
> **Example:** If one job takes 3-4 minutes while others complete after 30 seconds, the merge might is permitted prematurely.
>
> **Reason:** The ruleset requires all `ci_ok` jobs to pass, but if no `ci_ok` job is in progress (because dependent jobs are incomplete), it can lead to inconsistent merge conditions.

> [!TIP]
> To be sure that all `ci_ok` jobs are required to merge have all workflows each `ci_ok` job should have a unique name.
> By having unique names each job can have an exact match via the ruleset matcher.

> As an alternative having a unique CI workflows could be more straightforward, but sometime, like in `tuono` this could not be feasible because
